# Reanalysis

Climate reanalysis combines former observations that were recorded with today's weather model. This model also processes overlapping or missing records to generate a consistent time series of climate data.[^1]

## Downloading Datasets

There a two approaches how someone can download the datasets.

1. Downloading via [CDS Copernicus (Climate Data Store)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset) (requires a user account).
2. [CDS API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). There's also an official [Python API](https://github.com/ecmwf/cdsapi)
